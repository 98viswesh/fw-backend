# fw-backend

There are two files FW-backend.js and backmod.js.

'backmod' is the expected library the client can use to do operations on a local datastore. 
FW-backend.js file is a simple demonstration of how a user can use the functions of 'backmod'.

'backmod' library supports creation of a file, inserting key-value pair into the file, reading from the file, and deleting a key from the file. Appropriate error handling have been taken care of as much as possible.
The functionality of the library operations have been explained with the help of comments and most of the functional and non functional requirements have been considered.
